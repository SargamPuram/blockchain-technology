## üß™ Testing Every Function: A Step-by-Step Guide

We will pretend to be two different students, **Alice** and **Bob**, to test the security features of the contract.

---

### Transaction 1: Alice Registers Herself

**Who:** Use the **FIRST account** in the ACCOUNT dropdown. This is Alice.

**Action:** Find the `addStudent` function.

**Inputs:**
- `_name`: "Alice"
- `_rollno`: 101
- `_class`: "Grade 5"

**Click:** The orange **transact** button.

**Check:** Use `getStudentById` with `_id: 0`. You should see Alice's info and her address.

**Result:** Alice is now Student ID 0.

---

### Transaction 2: Bob Registers Himself

**Who:** **(IMPORTANT!)** Switch to the **SECOND account** in the ACCOUNT dropdown. This is Bob.

**Action:** Find the `addStudent` function.

**Inputs:**
- `_name`: "Bob"
- `_rollno`: 102
- `_class`: "Grade 6"

**Click:** The orange **transact** button.

**Check:** Use `getStudentById` with `_id: 1`. You should see Bob's info and the address of the second account.

**Result:** Bob is now Student ID 1.

---

### Transaction 3: Check the Total Students

**Action:** Click the blue `getTotalStudents` button.

**Result:** It should show **2**.

---

### Transaction 4: THE SECURITY TEST (Update)

#### The Hacker (Bob tries to change Alice's record)

**Who:** Make sure you are still on Bob's account (the second one).

**Action:** Go to `updateStudent`.

**Inputs:**
- `_id`: 0 (Alice's ID)
- `_newName`: "Hacker"
- `_newClass`: "Hacked"

**Click:** The **transact** button.

**Result:** IT WILL FAIL! ‚ùå The error will say "You are not the owner...". Security works!

#### The Owner (Alice updates her own record)

**Who:** Switch back to Alice's account (the first one).

**Action:** Go to `updateStudent`.

**Inputs:**
- `_id`: 0
- `_newName`: "Alice"
- `_newClass`: "Grade 7"

**Click:** The **transact** button.

**Result:** IT WILL SUCCEED! ‚úÖ

**Check:** Use `getStudentById` for ID 0 to see her new class.

---

### Transaction 5: THE SECURITY TEST (Delete)

#### The Hacker (Bob tries to delete Alice's record)

**Who:** Switch to Bob's account (the second one).

**Action:** Go to `deleteStudent`.

**Input:** `_id: 0` (Alice's ID)

**Click:** The **transact** button.

**Result:** IT WILL FAIL! ‚ùå

#### The Owner (Alice deletes her own record)

**Who:** Switch back to Alice's account (the first one).

**Action:** Go to `deleteStudent`.

**Input:** `_id: 0`

**Click:** The **transact** button.

**Result:** IT WILL SUCCEED! ‚úÖ

**Check:**
- Click `getTotalStudents`. It will now show **1**
- Use `getStudentById` for ID 0 ‚Äî it should now show Bob's info, because he was the last student and got moved into Alice's old spot

---

## üö® Troubleshooting: The "Invalid Opcode" Error

This is the most common error you'll encounter. It means you asked for something that doesn't exist.

**Cause:** Using `getStudentById` with an ID that's not in the list.

**Example:** You have 2 students (IDs 0 and 1) but ask for ID 2.

### How to Fix

1. Click the `getTotalStudents` button to see how many students exist
2. Only valid IDs are **0** to **getTotalStudents - 1**
3. Retry `getStudentById` with a valid ID
4. If all else fails, delete the deployed contract using the trash can icon and deploy a fresh one

---

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Each student can only update or delete their own record
- Student IDs start at 0 and increment with each new student
- When a student is deleted, the last student in the array takes their place
- Always check `getTotalStudents` before querying specific student IDs
- The contract enforces ownership, preventing unauthorized modifications

**Happy Testing! üéâ**
